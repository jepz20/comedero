Project Submission

You will develop a restaurant review application with a focus on accessibility.
You will remotely access JSON files containing restaurant information (including name,
a photograph, address, cuisine type and operating hours) as well as JSON files containing review information
for each restaurant (name of reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating and comments).
The reviews application must include an application header, and a menu providing multiple ways to filter
the restaurants (by cuisine, by location, etc). When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be
displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

Supporting Course: Web Accessibility coming May 2016.
